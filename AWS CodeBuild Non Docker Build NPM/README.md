# InvisiRisk BAF Setup for AWS Code Build (Non Docker)

This guide explains how to integrate the InvisiRisk BAF into your AWS CodeBuild pipeline. This setup assumes an Ubuntu runner where dependencies are installed **directly on the build machine**.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the `API_URL` and `APP_TOKEN` environment variables are set in your CodeBuild project before applying these changes.

---

## Modify `buildspec.yml`

Add the BAF startup at the start of the `pre_build` phase and cleanup steps at the start of the `post_build` phase to your `buildspec.yml`.

### Step 1: `pre_build` phase - start the BAF:

```yaml
pre_build:
  commands:
    - echo "InvisiRisk startup script..."
    - curl $API_URL/pse/bitbucket-setup/pse_startup | bash # Download and execute the BAF setup script.
    - . /etc/profile.d/pse-proxy.sh # Source the environment variables set by the setup script.
```

### Step 2: `post_build` phase - run the cleanup script:

```yaml
post_build:
  commands:
    - echo "Build complete!"
    - bash /tmp/pse_cleanup/cleanup.sh # Sends build data to the InvisiRisk portal.
```

### Full `buildspec.yml` example:

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo "InvisiRisk startup script..."
      - curl $API_URL/pse/bitbucket-setup/pse_startup | bash
      - . /etc/profile.d/pse-proxy.sh

  build:
    commands:
      - npm install

  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo "Build complete!"
      - bash /tmp/pse_cleanup/cleanup.sh
```

## Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set in the CodeBuild project:

| Variable     | Description                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `API_URL`    | https://app.invisirisk.com                |
| `APP_TOKEN`  | APP token received from InvisiRisk portal |

---

## Notes

- The BAF startup must complete before the `build` phase so that all network traffic during package installation is routed correctly.
- `PSE_PROXY_IP` is set automatically by the startup script and sourced via `/etc/profile.d/pse-proxy.sh`.
- The cleanup script in `post_build` should always run, even if the build fails.

---

## Appendix: What Changed in the `buildspec.yml`

The key change is the addition of the BAF startup and cleanup around your existing build commands:

| Addition | What it does |
|---|---|
| `curl $API_URL/pse/bitbucket-setup/pse_startup \| bash` | Downloads and starts the InvisiRisk PSE proxy on the build machine, and installs the PSE CA certificate so that HTTPS traffic can be inspected. |
| `. /etc/profile.d/pse-proxy.sh` | Sources the proxy environment variables set by the startup script, so that `npm` automatically routes all traffic through the BAF. |
| `bash /tmp/pse_cleanup/cleanup.sh` | Runs after the build to send the collected dependency data to the InvisiRisk portal. |
